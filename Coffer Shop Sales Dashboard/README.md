This Repository will hold all of the coffee shop raw data in Excel format
and the finish dashboard excel file.

We started by cleaning up the file using excel tools such as duplicate removal, changing data types, combining data from 2 different excel sheets with xlookup, multiple nested IF statements, INDEX MATCH statements, etc.

Next with used Pivot tables to build charts and make up our dashboard

I hope this helps someone out there in gaining the excel skills needed.
